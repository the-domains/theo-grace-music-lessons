Singer, songwriter, producer & guitarist.

Theo began singing when he was a young boy, playing guitar in his adolescence, started producing and DJ-ing in high school, and then wrote his first song (with lyrics) in college. He is self-taught, and has spent thousands of hours, studying, exploring and learning these crafts, which are each vast worlds of knowledge, skill, and magic making. Creating and expressing the art that lives in our soul is one of the most challenging and ecstatic experiences we can have as humans. Honing and refining our skills is a worthy endeavor.  

Combining practicality and spirituality, Theo's teaching style weaves information and technique with psycho-somatic awareness and emotional integration. This holistic approach not only offers the opportunity for skill building and artistic refinement, but for healing and personal transformation.
