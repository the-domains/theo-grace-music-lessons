Singer, songwriter, producer & guitarist.

Theo began singing when he was a young boy, playing guitar in his adolescence, started producing and DJ-ing in high school, and then wrote his first song in college. He is self-taught, and has spent thousands of hours, studying, exploring and learning these crafts, which are each in their own right, vast worlds of knowledge, skill, and magic making. Some of the most ecstatic feelings in life come through the act of creating and expressing art. 

For first time in his life, Theo is opening the doors to share his musical wisdom. Combining practicality and spirituality, Theo's teaching style weaves together information and technique with psycho-somatic awareness and integration. This holistic approach not only offers the opportunity for skill building and artistic refinement, but for healing and personal growth.

Through a one-on-one focused session, you can book time to explore and expand your creative frontiers with Theo.
